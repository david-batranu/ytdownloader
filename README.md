TO-DO LIST
================================================================
	[ ] implement other FFmpeg functions
	[ ] compile FFmpeg to support x86 Android ABI [wip]
	[ ] support subtitles download
	[ ] use icon/logo to identify codecs available 
        (expand the custom ShareActivity adapter)
	[ ] make the App tablet friendly
	[ ] use custom DM for other download tasks 
        (apk update, ffmpeg binary [wip - on hold])
	[ ] dashboard option to include downloaded videos into backups 
        (or make menu entry "archive")

KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================
	[x] Downloads running:
		- for a long time (around 20 or 30 minutes)
		AND 
		- without having the Dashboard Activity to the front
		may be forced to PAUSE. In this case a manual resume is needed.
