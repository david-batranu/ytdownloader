To be able to enjoy the 1080p and higher YouTube video resolutions, 
I added the Dashboard/FFmpeg feature to **MUX** (merge) a video-only 
and an audio-only streams into a single complete video.

**Downloads**

- enable the `Get secondary streams` preference;  
- go share a video to YTD;  
- click to download the desired **VO** stream *AND* an **AO** stream.

**After downloads completion**

- click on the VO video into the Dashboard;
- select the `Add audio stream (already downloaded)` entry;
- follow instructions to download the latest FFmpeg build 
  [if not already downloaded];
- wait for completion.

A complete video should be avaiable to open from the Dashboard, tagged with `MUX`.
